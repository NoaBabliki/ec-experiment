# eqivalent choices - experiment

almost done!
* need to decide if we use auto-complete or drop down menu for the second part fill-in
* need to finish local storage to store temporary data while website is running to prevent web page refresh bug

this version is without moduls - for react, express and axios - need to download before running
terminal run command: npm run dev

# For Yotam:
in client/src: constants
has constants that you can change

in server/inputs: category1.txt, category2.txt
input of this program will be a text file with category items, written in the following format:

item1
item2
item3
....

in server/outputs: client_category1.json, client_category2.json
outputs of the program - seperate json file for each category, for current participent
has fields: id - number (for programming usage), name - string (the name of the item - specified in inputs), rating - the rating the client gave to the item

I hope by next week I will finish this part and I will show you a run via zoom, so we will be sure this is ok.
